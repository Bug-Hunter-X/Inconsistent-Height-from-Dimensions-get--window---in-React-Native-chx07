This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  The `Dimensions.get('window')` method returns incorrect values, specifically a `height` that is smaller than expected, especially on Android devices.  This often happens when the application is running in a certain context, such as within a specific device configuration or when certain system UI elements are present (like the navigation bar or status bar). The inconsistency makes it difficult to properly layout components because dimensions are miscalculated.

```javascript
// Incorrect height value
const { height, width } = Dimensions.get('window');
console.log('Height:', height); // Height is unexpectedly small
```
